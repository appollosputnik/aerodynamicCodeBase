# aerodynamicCodeBase
This is an Aerocode base platform to exploit Aero activities with open source tools.

1.  We have an Aerofoil shape optimization tool, by name 'aerodynamics.xlsx'
2.  This Excel sheet calculate and can generate an Aerofoil or a 2D wing by specifying camber and thickness.
3.  And a code, Qt code, you can load this code in Qt Creator to draw any 3D surfaces.
4.  We have full set of Aerodynamic-CFD code in this  STRUCTURED AND UNSTRUCTURED PDE MAPPED GRID, and some a number of Solver. More details will be provided 
    as we progress over the period of time. 
5.  I am also writing a good quality manual so that you can play around with it.
